This is a collection of scripts for ChatGPT usage developed by BreakFree Solutions staff.

== Utilities 

=== chatgpt.sh 

Uses an API Token passed as a command line parameter to communicate with ChatGPT from a `bash` terminal session. Usage: 
    
    chatgpt.sh <OPENAI_API_TOKEN> <request>

Use this script within another, where the latter has your API Token hard-coded. For example, create a local script called `cgpt` and insert the following:

    #!/bin/bash
    chatgpt.sh <OPENAI_TOKEN> $@
